# release-npm-package

Minimal starting point for creating a npm package which can be released with one manual click or (if applicable) triggered automatically by an event. Requires conventional commits!

## Enabler: conventional commits

> The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

Putting in the effort to write machine readable commits at commit time frees us from creating a changelog and figuring out the next version number at release time. This makes releasing super simple and ensures that it happens often.

## Assumption: `dist` folder is released

Assumption: you have some kind of build step and you want to release only your build artifact (`dist` folder). Make sure to have a `package.json` in the `dist` folder before releasing.

## Good to know: package.json version

The `"version"` field in the `package.json` *in the repository* is never updated. It's always `"0.0.0-development"`. The *published* `package.json` though contains the version.

## Good to have: npm package provenance

It allows linking packages to their source and build and increases trust in the supply chain. This is only possible when the `npm release` runs on GitHub Actions, not when you release on your local machine.

Make sure to have the following config on your `package.json` to enable npm package provenance.

```json
"publishConfig": {
    "provenance": true
},
```

## Checklist

In case you just want to cherry pick for your exisiting package.

* `package.json`: set `"version"` to `"0.0.0-development"` (optional, but recommended)
* `package.json`: add `"publishConfig": { "provenance": true }` (optional, but recommended)
* repository settings: add a `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret (repo -> settings -> secrets and variables -> actions -> new repository secret). Find the value in 1Password ("NPM"), look for "Publish Token", its value starts with "npm_"
* copy `.github/workflows/release.yml` and adapt to your needs. Make sure to not remove permissions and too keep the configuration of the `setup-node` action.
* `npm install --save-dev semantic-release`
